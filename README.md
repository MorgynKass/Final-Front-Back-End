This is my final project for "Computer Programming".

This application is a task manager. You can login, create an account, and logout. Once you are logged in you will be able to create tasks and delete them.

The api folder contains all of the backend files.
The client folder contain all of the frontend files.

Branch "back-end" is the code I created for my backend.
Branch "front-end" is the code I created for my front-end.
